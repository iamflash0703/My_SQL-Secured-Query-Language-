-- Group By
-- When you use the GROUP BY clause in a MySQL query, it groups together rows that have the same values in the specified column or columns.
-- GROUP BY is going to allow us to group rows that have the same data and run aggregate functions on them

SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics;

-- when you use group by  you have to have the same columns you're grouping on in the group by statement
SELECT gender
FROM employee_demographics
GROUP BY gender
;


SELECT first_name
FROM employee_demographics
GROUP BY gender  #Error
;





SELECT occupation
FROM employee_salary
GROUP BY occupation
;

-- notice there is only one office manager row

-- when we group by 2 columns we now have a row for both occupation and salary because salary is different
SELECT occupation, salary
FROM employee_salary
GROUP BY occupation, salary
;

-- now the most useful reason we use group by is so we can perform out aggregate functions on them
SELECT gender, AVG(age)
FROM employee_demographics
GROUP BY gender
;

SELECT gender, MIN(age), MAX(age), COUNT(age),AVG(age)
FROM employee_demographics
GROUP BY gender
;



#The ORDER BY clause:
#The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
#The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics
ORDER BY first_name;

SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics;

SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics
ORDER BY first_name;


SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics
ORDER BY first_name DESC;

#Now we can also do multiple columns like this:

SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics
ORDER BY gender, age;

SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics
ORDER BY gender DESC, age DESC;




SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics
ORDER BY 5 DESC, 4 DESC;
